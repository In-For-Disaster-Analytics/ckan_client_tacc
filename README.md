## 📈 Releases

You can see the list of available releases on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/in_for_disaster_analytics/ckan-client-tacc/releases) page.

We follow [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification.

We use [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter). As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you’re ready. With the categories option, you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels.
